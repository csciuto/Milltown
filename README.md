Milltown

A SimCity style clone written with a Swing interface and all the graphical complexity of MSPaint.

This is a very large potential project that I never expect to actually complete, but I wanted to share it.

So far it:

* Has save/load functionality
* Zoomable map
* A few different building types
* A query tool
* A bulldoze tool
* A functioning simulation of canals that have or do not have water in them based on connection to water tiles.
